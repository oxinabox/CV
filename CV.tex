\section{EDA and Compiler Engineer at JuliaHub (2023 Feb -- 2024 July)}
I worked on the CedarEDA electronic simulation tool, where I focused on compiler transformations for solving differential algebraic equations.
A particularly important subset of this work was automatic differentiation, facilitating end-to-end differentiation of the simulation allowing, for example, differentiation of the rise-time with regards to the transistor width.
More broadly, I delved deep into the Julia compiler internals which were heavily reused in this tool, including inference, constant propagation and abstract interpretation.


\section {Research Software Engineering at Invenia Labs (2018 Oct - 2023 Feb)}
I was a founding member of research software engineering team, which existed to handle tasks to technical for researchers and too scientific for developers.
where I developed extensive experience in API design, machine learning, constrained and unconstrained optimisation, and automatic differentiation.
As team grew, I took on a management role (both people management and project management), while still maintaining significant technical contributions and up-skilling many junior developers.
From July 2022 on wards I was also the acting program manager, and eventually took on several other tasks from senior management.

\section{Open Source}
I am the a major contributor to to vastly too many projects to list here, both professionally and in my own time.
A more complete list is available at \url{https://github.com/oxinabox}.
Some of the more notable include: being the comaintainer of \emph{TensorFlow.jl} (now deprecated),
being the maintainer of \emph{DataStructures.jl}, being the creator and maintainer of \emph{LoggingExtras.jl} 
and being the leader of the \emph{ChainRules.jl} project.
The last of which is a moderately sized collaboration with folk from several different institutions to produce fundamental automatic differentiation tooling.
It has well-over 100 directly dependent packages and over 2500 indirectly dependent packages.
You can find various talks on this, and my other open source projects on YouTube, by searching for ``Frames White JuliaCon'' and ``Frames White EuroAD''.
