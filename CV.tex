\section{Recent Employment}
Since the completion of my PhD in Oct 2018, I have been on the Research Software Engineering Team at Invenia Labs.
Invenia Labs applies machine learning for forecasting and and optimization for decision making to improve performance of the US electricity grids, interacting with the dayahead-realtime markets.
This problem has many open research problems, and Invenia has many researchers working on them.
The Research Software Engineering Team was  created to help researchers do research better, and to help close the gap between research and production.
I was one of three founding members of that team and helps set it up to be a powerful force multiplier for the research division.
As a research software engineer, I helped design better systems that allowed researchers to modularly improve parts of our system and swap them out.
I also worked on software that was too scientific for most developers, but too technical for most researchers such as automatic differentitation and machine learning frameworks.

As the team grew, it eventually required a lead to take on a more managemental role.
This was a hybrid technical role, where I decreased amount of time on software development and spent more on supporting my team.
I conducted regular one-on-ones, assisted team members with developing profesional development plans, lead onboarding programs, and created a career ladder system to be rolled out company wide.

From July 2022 onwards, I also took on the role of acting program manager.
Assisting the CSO with coordinating the company-wide program of work, and leading our product and project managers.
This concluded with a large restructure of how the company works to allow us to be much more efficient and to facilitate the professional growth of employees.

\section{Open Source}
In 2022, I received the \textbf{Julia Community Award}, for my technical and social contributions to the JuliaLang ecosystem.
I am the a major contributor to too many projects to list here.
A complete list is available at \url{https://github.com/oxinabox}.
The more notable include: being the comaintainer of \emph{TensorFlow.jl} (now deprecated),
being the maintainer of \emph{DataStructures.jl}, being the creator and maintainer of \emph{LoggingExtras.jl} 
and being the leader of the \emph{ChainRules.jl} project.
The last of which is a moderately sized collaboration with folk from several different institutions to produce fundamental automatic differentiation tooling.
It has well-over 100 directly dependent packages and over 2500 indirectly dependent packages.
You can find various talks on this, and my other open source projects on YouTube, by searching for ``Frames White JuliaCon'' and ``Frames White EuroAD''.
