The algorithm minimises the total area of silicon utilised by a given circuit, whilst maintaining the propagation delay of the circuit within a hard limit. It assesses designs using the well-known circuit simulation engine SPICE, making allowance for the inability of SPICE to assess poorly-designed circuits within a reasonable timeframe. Experiments on three different types of circuits demonstrate that the algorithm is able to derive excellent designs for a range of problem instances, including several problems where the Monte Carlo method is unable to find any feasible solutions at all.},

  abstract  = {Several approaches for embedding a sentence into a vector space have been developed. However, it is unclear to what extent the sentence's position in the vector space reflects its semantic meaning, rather than other factors such as syntactic structure. Depending on the model used for the embeddings this will vary -- different models are suited for different down-stream applications. For applications such as machine translation and automated summarization, it is highly desirable to have semantic meaning encoded in the embedding. We consider this to be the quality of semantic localization for the model -- how well the sentences' meanings coincides with their embedding's position in vector space. Currently the semantic localization is assessed indirectly through practical benchmarks for specific applications.  In this paper, we ground the semantic localization problem through a semantic classification task. The task is to classify sentences according to their meaning. A SVM with a linear kernel is used to perform the classification using the sentence vectors as its input. The sentences from subsets of two corpora, the Microsoft Research Paraphrase corpus and the Opinosis corpus, were partitioned according to their semantic equivalence. These partitions give the target classes for the classification task. Several existing models, including URAE, PV--DM and PV--DBOW, were assessed against a bag of words benchmark},

  abstract  = {Many methods have been proposed to generate sentence vector representations, such as recursive neural networks, latent distributed memory models, and the simple sum of word embeddings (SOWE). However, very few methods demonstrate the ability to reverse the process -- recovering sentences from sentence embeddings. Amongst the many sentence embeddings, SOWE has been shown to maintain semantic meaning, so in this paper we introduce a method for moving from the SOWE representations back to the bag of words (BOW) for the original sentences. This is a part way step towards recovering the whole sentence and has useful theoretical and practical applications of its own. This is done using a greedy algorithm to convert the vector to a bag of words. To our knowledge this is the first such work. It demonstrates qualitatively the ability to recreate the words from a large corpus based on its sentence embeddings. As well as practical applications for allowing classical information retrieval methods to be combined with more recent methods using the sums of word embeddings, the success of this method has theoretical implications on the degree of information maintained by the sum of embeddings representation. This lends some credence to the consideration of the SOWE as a dimensionality reduced, and meaning enhanced, data manifold for the bag of words. },

  abstract = {Word sense embeddings are vector representations of polysemous words -- words with multiple meanings. These induced sense embeddings, however, do not necessarily correspond to any dictionary senses of the word. This limits their applicability in traditional semantic-orientated tasks such as lexical word sense disambiguation. To overcome this, we propose a method to find new sense embeddings of known meaning. We term this method refitting, as the new embedding is fitted to model the meaning of a target word in the example sentence. This is accomplished using the probabilities of the existing induced sense embeddings, as well as their vector values. Our contributions are threefold: (1) The refitting method to find the new sense embeddings;  (2) a novel smoothing technique, for use with the refitting method; and (3) a new similarity measure for words in context, defined by using the refitted sense embeddings. We show how our techniques improve the performance of the Adaptive Skip-Gram sense embeddings for word similarly evaluation; and how they allow the embeddings to be used for lexical word sense disambiguation -- which was not possible using the induced sense embeddings.},

These quality aspects can be judged using a combination of several linguistic features. However, most of the current image captioning metrics focus only on specific linguistic facets, such as the lexical or semantic, and fail to meet a satisfactory level of correlation with human judgements at the sentence-level. We propose a learning-based framework to incorporate the scores of a set of lexical and semantic metrics as features, to capture the adequacy and fluency of captions at different linguistic levels. Our experimental results demonstrate that composite metrics draw upon the strengths of standalone measures to yield improved correlation and accuracy.}

Our tool detects the main character that each section is from the POV of, and allows the user to generate a new ebook with only those sections. This gives consumers new options in how they consume their media; allowing them to  pursue the storylines sequentially, or skip chapters about characters they find boring.

  abstract = "Natural language is the human expression of thought. The representation of natural language, and thus thought, is fundamental to the field of artificial intelligence. This thesis explores that representation through weighted sums of embeddings. Embeddings are dense numerical vectors representing natural language components (e.g. words). Their sum is commonly overlooked as being too simple: in contrast to sequence or tree representations. However, we find that on numerous real-world problems it is actually superior. This thesis demonstrates this capacity, and explains why. The sum of embeddings is a particularly effective dimensionality-reduced representation of the crucial surface features of language.",

While current evaluation metrics tend to achieve an acceptable correlation with human judgements at the system level, they fail to do so at the caption level. In this work, we propose a neural network-based learned metric to improve the caption-level caption evaluation. To get a deeper insight into the parameters which impact a learned metric{\textquoteright}s performance, this paper investigates the relationship between different linguistic features and the caption-level correlation of the learned metrics. We also compare metrics trained with different training examples to measure the variations in their evaluation. Moreover, we perform a robustness analysis, which highlights the sensitivity of learned and handcrafted metrics to various sentence perturbations. Our empirical analysis shows that our proposed metric not only outperforms the existing metrics in terms of caption-level correlation but it also shows a strong system-level correlation against human assessments.",

Based on our past attempts at developing highly sophisticated learning-based metrics, we have discovered that a simple cosine similarity measure using the Mean of Word Embeddings (MOWE) of captions can actually achieve a surprisingly high performance on unsupervised caption evaluation. This inspires our proposed work on an effective metric WEmbSim, which beats complex measures such as SPICE, CIDEr and WMD at system-level correlation with human judgments. Moreover, it alsoachieves the best accuracy at matching human consensus scores for caption pairs, against commonly used unsupervised methods. Therefore, we believe that WEmbSim sets a new baseline for any complex metric to be justified.",
